# Strategy Pattern Sample #

This is a very simple example of implementing a strategy pattern given an initial code base where all strategies are combined and separated only by a switch statement. The commits of this repository are meant to be instructive for someone learning to implement this pattern, starting with the initial commit of functioning code (with passing tests), then a few steps demonstrating the refactoring one might use to clean up the code and improve its maintainability by implementing the strategy pattern.

Have a look through the commits to get a feel for the refactoring steps taken in this sample implementation.
